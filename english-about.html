            <h3>Macedonian Theatre Group (Boomerang) - Melbourne, Australia Inc.</h3>
            <p>Macedonian Theatre Group 'Boomerang' The Macedonian Theatre Group (MTG) 'Boomerang' was founded in Melbourne by Vic Stoikov, Mise Avtarovski and Jovan Naumovski on August 2, 1991 and was officially registered on October 17th, 1991 (Stoikov 1996). Since 1991, the MTG 'Boomerang' has completed seven productions around Australia and in the Republic of Macedonia. The following is a list of their productions: Melburn-Sydnej za inaet (Melbourne-Sydney Just for Spite) - November and December 1991; Dont Beri Galje (Don't Worry) - May and June 1992; Kaming za Avstralija (Coming to Australia) - December 1992 and January 1993; Dont Beri Galje 2 (Don't Worry 2) - October 1993 and January 1994; Kengurite Doagaat (The Kangaroos are Coming) - Ma y 1994; Paca se Vraka (Paca is Coming Back) - December 1994 and January 1995; Hava Ju Tumoro (How Are You Tomorrow?) - January 1996. Most of the plays were written and directed by Mise Avtarovski and Jovan Naumovski, and the performances have been attended by over 20,000 people, mainly from Macedonian background. 'Boomerang' video tapes are seen world-wide and have been shown on Macedonian television stations in Macedonia, Canada, the United States and Australia. The MTG is the first Macedonian Theatre Group from Melbourne to perform outside Melbourne. In 1994 it visited Macedonia, at the invitation of the Macedonian Ministry of Culture, to participate in the 'Vojdan Chemodrinski Drama Festival'. On that occasion the group presented the play Kengurite Doagaat (The Kangaroos are Coming) (Stoikov 1996). While each of the plays is distinctive in its set of characters, its thematic elements and its style, they also share a number of common elements. Each, in its own way, attempts to deal with the experience of people of Macedonian background trying to come to terms with life in Australia. The emotional tug of the "Motherland" is a constant factor, which Macedonians share with other migrant groups. The plays also deal with the constant struggle to maintain and perpetuate the Macedonian language,  cultural traditions and religion, and to represent community identity and to seek cohesion.</p>
